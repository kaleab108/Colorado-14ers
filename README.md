# Colorado-14ers
This project is a delightful endeavor that I enthusiastically pursue during my free time. Its focus lies on exploring the world of 14ers, specifically analyzing and categorizing them based on their hiking difficulty levels. A 14er refers to a mountain peak with an elevation of at least 14,000 feet, and this project aims to determine which among these majestic summits pose the easiest to the most challenging hikes.

By diving into the realm of 14ers, I embark on a journey that blends adventure, nature appreciation, and data analysis. Through meticulous research and analysis, I examine various factors that contribute to the level of difficulty for each mountain, such as elevation gain, trail conditions, steepness, and technical aspects. By combining these factors and applying statistical methodologies, I aim to generate insights and establish a ranking system that will offer outdoor enthusiasts valuable information when planning their hikes.

This project serves as an exciting outlet for me to merge my passion for data analysis with my love for outdoor exploration. With each 14er analyzed and categorized, I gain a deeper understanding of the diverse challenges and rewards that await those who embark on these hiking adventures. As I delve into this project during my leisure time, I am eager to uncover patterns, extract meaningful information, and contribute to the hiking community by providing valuable insights that can enhance hiking experiences and facilitate informed decision-making.
